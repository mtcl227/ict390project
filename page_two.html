    <h2>Modules Tutorial</h2>
    <p>So, you've installed Drupal and have heard a lot about these 'modules' that are supposed to make Drupal so dandy.
      Let's begin by installing a basic module. You can find modules at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module" title="Drupal module site" id="drupallink">Drupal's site</a>, or
      really just by Googling <q>Drupal -module name-</q>. So, search around a bit, read through some basic modules, and
      grab something you like by right clicking on the tar.gz link for your appropriate Drupal verison (Drupal 7 or Drupal 8, usually) at the end of the module's page and using <q>Copy Link Address</q>.
      Then, on your Drupal site while logged in as the administrator, navigate to the the Modules tab and click <q>Install new module</q>.
      Paste the link into the <q>Install from a URL</q> and clicking install. Then follow it up by enabling it from the list, and voila, it's
      on your site.
      <br></br>
      That isn't the end though. Next, you need to navigate to the <q>Blocks</q> tab and select a block to place your shiny new module in.
      For example, if you downloaded a Tetris game module, you might put it in one of the sidebars. Once that's done and you hit save, you'll see
      the module on your webpage!
    </p>
    <h2>Flex Slider</h2>
    <p>Now let's do something a little more complicated. Search for the Flex Slider module, and install it as described above.
      However, this time we're not done yet. You'll need the libraries for Flex Slider to work. You'll need to use a file transfer software
      and find the connection information for your website, including hostname, your admin username and password, and client. Connect via SFTP
      and you'll see your website has files like <q>Code</q>, <q>Sites</q>, etc.
      <br></br>
      Now is when you need the libraries. On Flex Slider's webpage, go to the GitHub link and download the .zip file with the libraries in it.
      Next, you'll need to use your file transfer software to move those libraries into the <q>libraries</q> file of your site. Once that's done,
      rename the file <q>flexslider</q>.
      <br></br>
      And then that's it, you're done! You can now use Flex Slider to make carousels of images and other neat things. Some other modules also require
      this sort of installation, so be sure to keep an eye out for the libraries when trying to get modules to work.
